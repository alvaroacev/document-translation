Asylum support
1. Overview
You may be able to get housing and money to support you and your family while you're
waiting to find out if you'll be given asylum.
This also means your children will go to a free state school and you may get free
healthcare from the National Health Service (NHS).
You can still apply for short-term support (https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/how-to-claim) if
you've been refused asylum and are preparing to leave the UK.
Call an asylum helpline (https://www.gov.uk/asylum-helplines) for free help with asylum
support or short-term support.
2. What you'll get
You can ask for somewhere to live, a cash allowance or both as an asylum seeker.
Housing
You'll be given somewhere to live if you need it. This could be in a flat, house, hostel or bed
and breakfast.
You can't choose where you live. It's unlikely you'll get to live in London or south-east
England.
Cash support
You'll get £37.75 for each person in your household. This will help you pay for things you
need like food, clothing and toiletries.
Your allowance will be loaded onto a debit card (ASPEN card) each week. You'll be able to
use the card to get cash from a cash machine.
If you've been refused asylum
You'll be given:
• somewhere to live
• £35.39 per person on a payment card for food, clothing and toiletries
You won't be given:
• the payment card if you don't take the offer of somewhere to live

you've been refused asylum.
You'll need to request form MAT B1 from your doctor to apply for the payment. You can
apply for the maternity payment at the same time you apply for asylum support.
If you get pregnant after you've applied for asylum support, you can apply to the support
team (https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/further-information) that dealt with your application
for asylum support.

school meals (https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals).
